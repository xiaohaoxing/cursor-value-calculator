# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-09-10

This browser extension “Cursor Usage Cost Overlay” is committed to protecting your privacy. This document explains how the extension handles your information.

## What we collect
- The extension does not collect, store, or share any personal data or browsing content.
- All logic runs locally in your browser, reading the current page’s DOM (extracting USD amounts and summing them). No data is sent to any remote server.

## Permissions
- The extension only injects content scripts on `https://cursor.com/*` and `https://www.cursor.com/*` to provide its functionality. No additional sensitive permissions are requested.

## Third-party services
- The extension does not integrate analytics, ads, or other third-party tracking services.

## Data security
- Since there is no network transmission and no local storage of personal data, there is no risk of data leakage.

## Changes
- If this policy changes materially, we will update this file in the repository and note it in the release notes.

## Contact
- For questions or suggestions regarding this policy, please reach out via the repository’s Issues.
